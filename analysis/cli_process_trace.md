# Tracing the Process of Handling `gemini -p <prompt>`

When a user runs `gemini -p <prompt>`, the following process occurs:

## 1. Entry Point and Argument Parsing

1. **CLI Entry Point**: The command starts at `packages/cli/index.ts`, which imports and calls the `main()` function from `packages/cli/src/gemini.tsx`.

2. **Argument Parsing**: In `main()`, the CLI arguments are parsed using `yargs` through the `parseArguments()` function in `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts`.
   - The `-p` flag is defined as an alias for `--prompt` with the description "Prompt. Appended to input on stdin (if any)."
   - The parsed arguments are stored in a `CliArgs` object, with the prompt value accessible as `argv.prompt`.

### Data Types

```typescript
// Raw command-line arguments from process.argv
type RawArgs = string[];

// Parsed arguments from yargs
type CliArgs = {
  prompt?: string;
  promptInteractive?: boolean;
  // Other potential CLI flags
  [key: string]: any;
};
```

## 2. Configuration Loading

3. **Configuration Setup**: After parsing arguments, `loadCliConfig()` is called to create a `Config` object that encapsulates all the CLI settings.
   - The prompt from `argv.prompt` is used to set the initial question in the config.
   - The config determines if the CLI should run in interactive mode based on whether there's a prompt and if stdin is a TTY.

### Data Types

```typescript
// Represents the fully resolved configuration for the CLI session
type Config = {
  question: string;
  interactive: boolean;
  // Other configuration properties like client instances, etc.
};
```

## 3. Determining Execution Mode

4. **Mode Detection**: The CLI determines if it should run in interactive or non-interactive mode:
   - Since a prompt is provided with `-p`, and there's no `-i` flag, it will run in non-interactive mode.
   - This is determined by the line: `const interactive = !!argv.promptInteractive || (process.stdin.isTTY && question.length === 0);`

### Data Types

```typescript
// Represents the two possible execution modes of the CLI
type ExecutionMode =
  | { type: 'Interactive' }
  | { type: 'NonInteractive' };
```

## 4. Handling Stdin (if applicable)

5. **Stdin Reading**: If stdin is not a TTY (meaning data is being piped in), the CLI reads from stdin:
   - The `readStdin()` function in `packages/cli/src/utils/readStdin.ts` is used to read up to 8MB of data from stdin.
   - If both stdin data and a prompt are provided, they are concatenated with the prompt appended to the stdin data.

### Data Types

```typescript
// Represents the content read from standard input
type StdinContent = string | null;

// The final prompt after combining stdin and the -p flag
type FullPrompt = string;
```

## 5. Non-Interactive Execution

6. **Non-Interactive Processing**: Since we're using `-p`, the CLI enters non-interactive mode:
   - The `runNonInteractive()` function in `packages/cli/src/nonInteractiveCli.ts` is called.
   - This function handles the communication with the Gemini API without user interaction.

## 6. API Communication

7. **Gemini API Interaction**: In `runNonInteractive()`:
   - A Gemini client is obtained from the config.
   - The prompt is sent to the Gemini API as a user message.
   - The response is streamed to stdout as it's received.
   - If the model requests tool calls, they are executed and the results are sent back to the model.

### Data Types

```typescript
// Represents a message sent by the user
type UserMessage = {
  role: 'user';
  content: string;
};

// Represents a response from the model
type ModelResponse =
  | { type: 'Content'; content: string }
  | { type: 'ToolCall'; toolName: string; args: any };

// Represents the result of a tool execution
type ToolResult = {
  type: 'ToolResult';
  toolName: string;
  result: any;
};

// Represents the entire conversation history
type Conversation = (UserMessage | ModelResponse | ToolResult)[];
```

## 7. Output and Exit

8. **Output and Termination**:
   - The model's response is written directly to stdout.
   - When the conversation is complete (no more tool calls), a final newline is added.
   - The process exits with code 0.

### Data Types

```typescript
// Represents the process exit code
type ExitCode = 0 | 1;
```

## Key Code Paths

- **Entry Point**: `packages/cli/index.ts` â†’ `main()` in `packages/cli/src/gemini.tsx`
- **Argument Parsing**: `parseArguments()` in `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts`
- **Configuration**: `loadCliConfig()` in `packages/cli/src/config/config.ts`
- **Stdin Handling**: `readStdin()` in `packages/cli/src/utils/readStdin.ts`
- **Non-Interactive Execution**: `runNonInteractive()` in `packages/cli/src/nonInteractiveCli.ts`

This process allows users to quickly get responses from Gemini without entering an interactive session, making it suitable for scripting and automation.
