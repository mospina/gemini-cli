### **Phase 1 Artifact: High-Level Architectural Overview**

This document outlines the macro-architecture of the Gemini CLI, defining the roles of its primary components and their relationships with each other and external systems.

#### **1. Component Breakdown & Responsibilities**

The Gemini CLI monorepo is logically divided into three distinct, high-level components (packages), each with a clear separation of concerns:

*   `packages/core`: **The Engine/Headless Library.** This package contains the core business logic and is designed to be environment-agnostic.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   **API Abstraction:** Encapsulates all direct communication with the Google Gemini API and authentication services (`code_assist`, `mcp`, `google-auth-library`). It provides a clean interface (`GeminiClient`, `GeminiChat`) to the rest of the application.
        *   **Tooling Framework:** Defines the abstractions for "tools" (`tools/tools.ts`), manages their discovery and registration (`tools/tool-registry.ts`), and provides implementations for core functionalities (e.g., `edit.ts`, `shell.ts`).
        *   **Service Layer:** Provides services that abstract away complex functionalities like file system discovery, Git interactions, and chat recording (`services/`).
        *   **Data Models:** Defines the primary data structures used throughout the application (e.g., `Content`, `Turn`, `ToolResult`).

*   `packages/cli`: **The User Interface & Application Host.** This is the primary user-facing executable. It acts as the host application that consumes `packages/core` and renders the interactive terminal experience.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   **Application Entry Point:** Contains the main executable entry point (`index.ts`) that bootstraps the entire application.
        *   **UI Rendering:** Manages the entire terminal user interface using the Ink library (inferred from `.tsx` files and React dependencies). This includes rendering history, prompts, spinners, and dialogs (`ui/`).
        *   **State Management:** Holds the UI state, primarily through React hooks (`ui/hooks/`). This includes managing the conversation history, user input, and streaming state.
        *   **Command Parsing & Dispatch:** Handles user input, parses slash commands (`/help`, `/clear`), and dispatches them to the appropriate services or actions (`services/CommandService.ts`).
        *   **Configuration Loading:** Responsible for loading and merging configuration from various sources (e.g., user settings, project settings) (`config/`).

*   `packages/vscode-ide-companion`: **The IDE Integration Server.** This is a VS Code extension that runs within the IDE. It provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that the CLI can connect to for context-aware operations.
    *   **Responsibilities:**
        *   **IDE Server:** Implements an MCP server (`ide-server.ts`) that exposes IDE-specific functionalities to the CLI.
        *   **Context Provider:** Gathers context from the IDE, such as the list of open files, the active file, and selected text (`open-files-manager.ts`).
        *   **Diff View Management:** Manages the creation and state of visual diff views within the IDE (`diff-manager.ts`), allowing the CLI to request that the user review changes in their native editor.

#### **2. Key External Dependencies**

The `package.json` files reveal a modern TypeScript stack that informs the architecture:

*   **`@google/genai` & `google-auth-library`:** Confirms that `packages/core` directly handles the Gemini API communication and authentication.
*   **`react` & `ink`:** Confirms that `packages/cli` uses a declarative, component-based model for its terminal UI, which is a sophisticated choice over simple stdout printing.
*   **`yargs`:** Used in `packages/cli` for initial command-line argument parsing before the interactive UI takes over.
*   **`@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`:** This is a key dependency in `packages/vscode-ide-companion` and `packages/core`, confirming the use of the Model Context Protocol for communication between the CLI and the IDE extension.
*   **`vitest` & `msw`:** A modern testing stack, indicating a commitment to unit and integration testing with a focus on mocking network requests.

#### **Conclusion of Phase 1**

The Gemini CLI employs a well-structured, multi-package architecture that clearly separates its core logic from its user-facing and integration-specific components. This design is highly modular, allowing the `core` engine to be potentially reused in other contexts beyond the interactive terminal. The use of React/Ink for the CLI and a dedicated MCP server for IDE integration points to a sophisticated and feature-rich application design.

This high-level understanding provides a solid foundation for the next phase.
